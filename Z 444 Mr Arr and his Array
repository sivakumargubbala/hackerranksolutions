Given an array, Mister Arr the owner of the array wants to move each element k places to its left. I.E. the array a[0],a[1],a[2],...a[n] becomes a[1],a[2]...a[n],a[0] after moving one place to the left. Note that the first element becomes the last element after each rotation. Mister Arr was up all night watching a football match and hence is sleeping now. He has given you the task to rotate the entire array K places to its left.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and k (the number of left rotations you must perform). The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= k <= n
1 <= a[i] <= 10^6

Output Format

Print a single line of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d left rotations.

Sample Input 0

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 0

5 1 2 3 4

Code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{
    int n,rotation;
    scanf("%d%d",&n,&rotation);
    int arr[n],i;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)    scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
    for(i=rotation;i<n;i++) printf("%d ",arr[i]);
    for(i=0;i<rotation;i++) printf("%d ",arr[i]);
    return 0;
}
